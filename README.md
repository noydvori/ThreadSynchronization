# ThreadSynchronization
Thread Synchronization for News Broadcast
Objective: Implemented a concurrent programming project to simulate a news broadcasting system. Explored synchronization mechanisms to manage multiple threads efficiently.

Key Components:

Producers: Generated strings representing news stories of various types.
Dispatcher: Sorted and distributed news stories to respective editors.
Co-Editors: Edited received messages before forwarding to the screen manager.
Screen Manager: Displayed edited news stories to the screen and managed final output.
Technical Details:

Implemented a bounded buffer with thread-safe operations for inter-thread communication.
Utilized synchronization constructs such as semaphores to manage access to shared resources.
System configuration specified in a file format, allowing flexibility in defining producer tasks and queue sizes.
Programming Language: C (Not C++)
Submission Requirements: A zip file named ID.zip containing all C files, headers, and a makefile. The executable file generated by the makefile must be named ex3.out.

Getting Started Suggestions:

Implemented a queue object to fulfill the bounded buffer requirements.
Developed different threads for producers, dispatcher, and screen manager.
Wrote the main function to read the configuration file and initialize the system.
Debugged step by step, starting with a single producer before expanding to the general case.
Note: Communication between threads handled via a shared bounded buffer. Global buffer declaration or passing buffer pointers during thread creation are suggested solutions.

Submission Command Example:

bash
Copy code
ex3.out config.txt
Additional Instructions: All queries regarding the assignment should be directed to the forum on Moodle.
